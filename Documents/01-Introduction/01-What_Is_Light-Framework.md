# What Is Light-Framework
Light-Framework is a really simple framework for building [SPA (Single Page Application)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). I want this framework to be minimal, so the framework itself only provides a component system and several other functionalities, but other functionalities can be easily added using the plugin system.

* "Only use the things you need." that's what he said (me).

## Keep Things Simple
You don't need hundreds of kilobytes to build a simple [SPA (Single Page Application)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), so why not just keep things simple? That's why Light-Framework doesn't have complex concepts, and contains some basic functionalities.

## Downsides
Nothing is perfect, and Light-Framework is no exception.

* **More Code**: You may need to write more code compared to other frameworks. (Although I don't think this is a bad thing on a small scale, because you should understand what's happening in your program, and writing your own code can be helpful.)
* **Not For Scale**: Light-Framework is not for large-scale applications, because sometimes "simple" just makes everything more "complicated".
