# Basic Concepts
When you're building a [SPA (Single Page Application)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) with Light-Framework, the page layout should all be components (like navbar, side menu, page content, etc...).

* **Not Too Many**: I don't recommend creating a lot of Light-Framework components, because that'll hurt the performance. Sometimes if you have something that appears a lot in a single page, I'll suggest you to just use vanilla JavaScript to handle it.
